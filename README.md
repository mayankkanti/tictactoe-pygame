# Tic Tac Toe Game with Pygame

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using Pygame. The game includes a main menu, game selection screen, and two game modes: Player vs Player (PvP) and Player vs Bot (PvB).

This is me trying to implement the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) for a game of tic-tac-toe!

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mayankkanti/tictactoe-pygame.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd tictactoe-pygame
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the game, execute the following command:
```sh
python src/main.py
```

## Game Modes

- **Player vs Player (PvP)**: Two players can play against each other.
- **Player vs Bot (PvB)**: Play against an unbeatable bot.

## Controls

- **Main Menu**: Press Enter to start the game.
- **Game Selection**: Use Up and Down arrow keys to navigate, Enter to select, and ESC to go back.
- **In-Game**: Click on the cells to make a move, and press ESC to go back to the game selection screen.
